**<Integrated Single-Cell and Spatial Analysis Reveals Retention of FCRL4⁺ Memory B Cells in Pediatric Tonsillar Hypertrophy>**

Pediatric tonsillar hypertrophy (TH) is a major cause of sleep-disordered breathing, which contributes to long-term cardiometabolic and neurocognitive morbidity.
Despite its clinical importance, the underlying immune mechanisms driving tonsillar enlargement remain poorly understood.
To address this gap, we explored pediatric tonsils with integrated single-cell and spatial analysis, encompassing transcriptomic and proteomic layers across discovery and validation cohorts (n = 77).
Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed selective expansion of FCRL4⁺ memory B cells (MBCs) in hypertrophic tonsils, indicating restricted germinal-center maturation and a tissue-retained regulatory program.
Spatial transcriptomic profiling confirmed that these cells were specifically localized to the follicular mantle zone, where they exhibited features of a retained and quiescent phenotype.
This expansion occurred independently of changes in follicular helper T (Tfh) cells but was accompanied by an increase in CXCR5⁺ IL-10⁺ FOXP3⁻ follicular type-1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells, whose frequency strongly correlated with FCRL4⁺ MBCs.
Trajectory analysis revealed that FCRL4⁺ MBCs normally transition through an FCRL4⁻ intermediate toward plasmablasts, but this differentiation path was blocked in hypertrophic tonsils.
Ligand–receptor modeling identified a CTLA-4–CD86 checkpoint between Tr1 cells and FCRL4⁺ MBCs that suppresses NFATC1-dependent activation, explaining the arrested plasmablast transition.
